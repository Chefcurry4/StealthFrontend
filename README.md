## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/9a1bc962-3c20-4c50-97f3-605b5e43d674) and start prompting. BUT Don't overuse the prompts there !!!.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE (VS Code), you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

Yes, this is also an option... 

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## How can I deploy this project?

This is what lovable suggests...

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/9a1bc962-3c20-4c50-97f3-605b5e43d674) and click on Share -> Publish. 
To connect a domain, navigate to Project > Settings > Domains and click Connect Domain. Read more here: [Setting up a custom domain](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain#custom-domain)

But probably we'll do more research regarding that.. Maybe using Netlify for the hosting and buying a custom third-partly domain.
